                     hello, my name is Jerome Mojica as CJonesOveHevun,
                     derived from random name Crowbar Jones and <i>The World Over Heaven ; Jojo's bizzare adventure: Eyes
                      of heaven</i>. This name was created for Github when starting to develop games just for fun. It wasn't thought
                      out or something but it was embraced by it's progression.
                      I've been developing a game called <b>Duel Masters, Neon Chaose ,FPS Game, lastly a text-editor softawre called
                      the Lunnary</b> These games were further developed during pandemic era esp. in year
                     2020.With learning rigorously, I decided to continue the game development.
                  </p>
