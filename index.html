                    <h2>Jerome Delos Santos Mojica / 20y / Student</h2>
                    <h2>Why do you want to be a Developer?</h2>
                    <p>During my younger years, I grappled with choosing a career path that would provide both financial stability 
and allow me to assist others. Initially, considering a career in the IT industry, specifically as a 
Developer, seemed out of reach due to its unfamiliarity in our country at that time. Drawing on my talent 
for drawing and sketching, I ultimately settled on pursuing a career as an architect. However, my enthusiasm 
waned as I realized the high costs associated with becoming an architect, a realization that was underscored 
by one of my cousins.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Do you have plans on becoming Graphic Designer?</h2>
                    <p>I do not have plans for it. As far as i know, becoming a designer
has its own difficulties and i am a person who end up easily on burnt-out. I only design just
for fun. I kept my skills on designing for some purposes like web desgining and video game
development. I thought these skills are worth it and it paid-off. But I will still consider
to learn and improve it in the future.

Since childhood, I've been captivated by sketching and doodling.
Blank paper (and sometimes even books!) became irresistible invitations to create. 
However, I eventually transitioned to digital art, captivated by its limitless 
possibilities. Unlike traditional art, digital tools allow me to unlock creative 
features and explore artistic boundaries.

Digital art has become my primary creative outlet.
I particularly enjoy crafting landscapes, my artistic specialty. Occasionally,
I delve into character portraits as well. As you'll see in the artwork below, my 
creations are heavily influenced by fantasy themes. This love of fantasy 
eventually inspired me to connect some of these pieces, weaving a narrative 
about the world I've built.
