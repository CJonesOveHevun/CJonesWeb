                    <h2>Why do you want to be a Developer?</h2>
                    <p>In my youth times, I am always worry about choosing the right course, where I am assured
that I can make a living while also helping others. The thought of becoming a Developer
initialy was seemingly impossible to think at the time and IT industry in our country was not yet
popular. Given with my talent on drawing, sketching. It was decided to becoming as an architect.
But eventually, I lost interest on it because of how costly becoming one. It was meticously evident
from one of my cousin.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Do you have plans on becoming Graphic Designer?</h2>
                    <p>I do not have plans for it. As far as i know, becoming a designer
has its own difficulties and i am a person who end up easily on burnt-out. I only design just
for fun. I kept my skills on designing for some purposes like web desgining and video game
development. I thought these skills are worth it and it paid-off. But I will still consider
to learn and improve it in the future.

Since childhood, I've been captivated by sketching and doodling.
Blank paper (and sometimes even books!) became irresistible invitations to create. 
However, I eventually transitioned to digital art, captivated by its limitless 
possibilities. Unlike traditional art, digital tools allow me to unlock creative 
features and explore artistic boundaries.

Digital art has become my primary creative outlet.
I particularly enjoy crafting landscapes, my artistic specialty. Occasionally,
I delve into character portraits as well. As you'll see in the artwork below, my 
creations are heavily influenced by fantasy themes. This love of fantasy 
eventually inspired me to connect some of these pieces, weaving a narrative 
about the world I've built.
